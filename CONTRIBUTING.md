## I Have a Question

Do feel free to reach out to me at vignesh.vaidyanathan@hololinked.dev. I will try my very best to respond. 

Nevertheless, if you want to ask a question, one may refer the available how-to section of the documentation [Documentation](https://hololinked.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
If the documentation is insufficient for any reason including being poorly documented, one may open a new discussion in the Q&A section of GitHub discussions. 

For questions related to workings of HTTP, basic concepts of python like descriptors, decorators etc., it is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.
For generic questions related to web of things standards or its ideas, I recommended to join web of things [discord](https://discord.com/invite/RJNYJsEgnb) group and [community](https://www.w3.org/community/wot/) group.

If you believe your question might also be a bug, you might want to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked/issues) that might help you. 
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. If an issue is not found:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (OS, python version etc.), depending on what seems relevant.
- 
One may submit a bug report at any level of information. But the following information is useful:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

> ### Legal Notice <!-- omit in toc -->
> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

Developers are always welcome to contribute to the code base. If you want to tackle any issues, un-existing features, let me know (at my email), I can create some 
open issues and features which I was never able to solve or did not have the time. The lack of issues or features in the Issues section of github does not mean the project 
is considered feature complete. 

There are also repositories in [React](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-portal), [Documentation](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-docs) which needs significant improvement, 
[examples](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-examples) which can use your skills. 

### Suggesting Enhancements

Please write to me at my email.
